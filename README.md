go-coinbase
=======

A Coinbase API client in Go (golang). Focus is currently on buying and selling BTC, but eventually all methods will be supported.

Usage
-----

* First, get yourself a Coinbase api key: https://coinbase.com/account/api

* Become familiar with the rate limits that apply to your account: https://coinbase.com/verifications

* Install the library:

        go get github.com/grantmd/go-coinbase

* Include it in your project:

        import "github.com/grantmd/go-coinbase"

* Setup your Coinbase client:

        c := &coinbase.Client{
        	APIKey: os.Getenv("COINBASE_API_KEY"),
        	APISecret: os.Getenv("COINBASE_API_SECRET"),
        }

* Make a call with your API key:

		balance, err := c.AccountBalance()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	
		fmt.Printf("%+v\n", balance)
